			Thought At Work originated as a small Industrial Design conference created by dedicated RIT students. <br><br>
			Now that it draws crowds of over <strong>500 attendees</strong>, the conference includes all types of industry professionals: Industrial Design, Interactive Design, Illustration, Motion, Graphic Design, 3D Digital Design, Experiential Design, Film and Animation, Fine Art, and more.<br><br>
			We inspire students and professionals to step up and bridge the gap between classroom and industry. <strong>We hope youâ€™ll be a part of it.</strong>
