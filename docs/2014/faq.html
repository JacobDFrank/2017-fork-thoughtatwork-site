        	<h1> I'm coming from far away! How do I get there?</h1>
            <p>Look up Rochester Institute of Technology on any map! If you're flying, the Greater Rochester International Airport is about twenty minutes away. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Where can I stay?</h1>
            <p>If you're looking for a hotel, we recommend the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/ritinn/" target="_blank"> RIT Inn </a> or the <a href="http://www.radisson.com/rochester-hotel-ny-14623/nyrochrd" target="_blank"> Rochester Radisson </a>, both conveniently five minutes away from our campus. If you're looking to save money, though, some of RIT's design students are willing to offer up their couches. If you need a couch to crash on, send <a href="mailto:kah3770@rit.edu" target="_blank"> Kelly </a> an email. We'll connect you with one of our students!</p>
        </div>

            <h1>What time should I arrive?</h1>
            <p>Our registration table opens at 9am on Friday, so feel free to get here anytime! Our opening reception will be held at 1pm, so you can grab lunch or hang with us if you get here early. If you're couch-surfing with someone, be sure to get their contact information so you can meet up on campus beforehand.</p>

            <p>Also, RIT's <a href="http://vignellicenter.rit.edu/" target="_blank">Vignelli Center </a>, home to the archive of designers Massimo and Leila Vignelli, will be open for tours starting at noon on Friday, so feel free to sign up for a tour once you've checked in.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Where should I go first?</h1>
            <p>Here's an <a href="http://maps.rit.edu/" target="_blank"> interactive map of RIT!</a> Guest parking will be available in lots G and H. Once you've parked, head towards the Booth building (labeled 'BOO' on this map) - signs will point you inside and to our registration table. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>What about the rest of the weekend?</h1>
            <p>After you check in, our very first event will be a formal opening in RIT's University Gallery, on Friday at 1pm. Students at the registration table will point you in the right direction. At the opening, we'll explain everything you'll need to know.</p>
            <p>Once you check in, you'll be given a brochure that will show each day's events. You can preview what's to come by looking at our <a href="http://thoughtatwork.cias.rit.edu/schedule" target="_blank"> schedule</a>. It's being updated every day as we get closer to the conference, so keep checking back!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Should I bring anything?</h1>
            <p>If you have a portfolio, please bring it along for our Portfolio Review on Friday night! You'll get the chance to have a one-on-one critique with any of our speakers. </p>
            <p>Also, because this is a networking opportunity, we highly recommend bringing business cards or anything else you'd want to give or show to other designers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>How should I dress?</h1>
            <p>Casual but presentable is recommended.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Will I get stuff?</h1>
            <p>Yep, you'll get stuff! We'll have some freebies for you - and we'll be announcing at our opening ceremony how to enter our giveaway for 1 of 10 free Keyshot licenses! </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>Can I show off my design skills?</h1>
            <p>Of course! Thought at Work is all about bringing together students from all over to learn, network and have fun. We will have an electronic slideshow on display, to showcase student work from anyone attending. This is a great chance for you to see what students from other schools are making, what their curriculums focus on, and how they address design.</p>
            <p>Send <a href="mailto:jjh5568@rit.edu">Joe</a> an email with your work attached as a PDF or image file. It can be an entire portfolio, a single project, or whatever you want! Your name and school will be displayed alongside your work.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>What food will be provided?</h1>
            <p>Our Friday night dinner will be catered by Wings Over Rochester (with vegetarian options, of course!) hosted in our own industrial design studio. That night's events will end with an afterparty at Lovin' Cup, a cafe and bar within walking distance of RIT. </p>
            <p>We will provide a variety of food for Saturday's lunch, outside RIT's Student Alumni Union. You will be free to get dinner on your own at any of our on-campus locations, which will be listed on your conference brochure. From 9-11pm, we will be hosting a late-night reception at a restaurant owned by Chuck Cerankosky, an alumni of our industrial design program.</p>
            <p>A light breakfast will be provided on Sunday, and a lunch break will be provided.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1>What else should I expect from this conference, anyway?</h1>
            <p>Expect to make connections with esteemed designers currently at work in their field. Expect to network and have fun with other design students from all over. Expect to learn a lot and to have a great time!</p>
